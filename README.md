Architectural Portfolio's website (2010 version)

---

### Tech bits & pieces used:

    coffeescript, jquery animations (much wow), sinatra, haml and sass


designed and coded for my wife's birthay (in 2010)

---

### todos:

it would be nice to convert the jquery vanilla js doing css transitions and to work on a threejs version of the website (possibly making mine and her UI/UX design portfolio site as well)
